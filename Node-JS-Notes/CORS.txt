1) CORS stands for Cross Origin Resource Sharing
2) A mechanism that allows a server to specify which origin it allows to have access to is pages.

3) Imagine you have two sites i.e Site A and B

	A Full Stack App
	
	Site A => Front-End
	Site B => Back-End

	Site B (Server) will receive the request from Site A (Client)
	Site B should not by default be allowed to receive requests and return to responses to any website.
	The reason is that it becomes insecure. We don't want malicious website to be able to fetch data from our server.
	
	Because the server contain sensitive information i.e Sessions, Cookies, auth data, Login Credentials etc

	So for that reason our server should specify who can fetch data from our server or Database.

	Origin = port, server, or hosting service

	In headers we specify which domain it allows to get request.
	
	We need to add Header which Access-Control-Allow-Origin Header and set the value of frontend domain
	the value of it.
